The ability of machines to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and understand the world around them has always fascinated me. From self-driving cars to medical imaging and even augmented reality, the possibilities seem endless.</p> <p>In this blog post, I want to share why I‚Äôm so passionate about AI and computer vision and how I hope to contribute to this field in the future.</p> <h4 id="the-power-of-ai--computer-vision">The Power of AI &amp; Computer Vision</h4> <p>Computer vision allows machines to analyze and interpret visual data, just like humans do‚Äîbut often faster and with greater precision. Some real-world applications that excite me include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles</strong> ‚Äì Teaching cars to perceive the road and make real-time decisions.</li> <li><strong>Medical Imaging</strong> ‚Äì AI-powered diagnostics that can detect diseases from X-rays and MRIs.</li> <li><strong>Facial Recognition &amp; Biometrics</strong> ‚Äì Enhancing security and authentication systems.</li> <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) &amp; Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> ‚Äì Creating immersive digital experiences.</li> <li><strong>Agriculture &amp; Environmental Monitoring</strong> ‚Äì Using drones to analyze crops and detect environmental changes.</li> </ul> <p>Each of these applications has the potential to transform industries and improve lives, which is what makes this field so exciting to me.</p> <h4 id="how-i-got-interested-in-computer-vision">How I Got Interested in Computer Vision</h4> <p>My interest in computer vision started with <strong>[ece176]</strong>. As I learned more, I realized how powerful AI-driven vision systems could be.</p> <p>Some key moments in my learning journey:</p> <ol> <li><strong>[First exposure to AI/ML]</strong> ‚Äì I took a class or read a paper that introduced me to AI.</li> <li><strong>[First project]</strong> ‚Äì I worked on <strong>[handwritten number detection]</strong>, which deepened my interest.</li> <li><strong>[Recent research/paper that inspired you]</strong> ‚Äì I came across <strong>[mention paper or breakthrough]</strong>, which made me want to explore further.</li> </ol> <h4 id="what-i-want-to-explore-next">What I Want to Explore Next</h4> <p>As I continue my studies at UCSD, I‚Äôm eager to:</p> <ul> <li>Join a research lab focused on AI and computer vision.</li> <li>Work on projects related to <strong>[image segmentation, object detection, generative models, and so on]</strong>.</li> <li>Contribute to open-source projects or competitions like Kaggle.</li> <li>Learn more about deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.</li> </ul> <h4 id="the-future-of-ai--computer-vision">The Future of AI &amp; Computer Vision</h4> <p>Looking ahead, I believe that AI-powered vision systems will become even more advanced, with applications we can‚Äôt even imagine yet. Some areas I‚Äôm excited to follow:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AI-powered creativity</strong> ‚Äì Using computer vision for art, music, and design.</li> <li><strong>Ethics &amp; bias in AI</strong> ‚Äì Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI-driven decisions.</li> <li><strong>Generalized AI models</strong> ‚Äì Creating AI systems that can adapt to multiple tasks like humans.</li> </ul> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúThe real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.‚Äù<br/> ‚Äî Marcel Proust</p> </blockquote> <p>I‚Äôm excited to dive deeper into AI and computer vision and connect with others who share this passion.

As a sophomore at UCSD looking to join a computer vision research lab, I wanted a platform to showcase my skills, projects, and interests. This blog post shares my experience building my site and what I learned along the way.</p> <h4 id="why-i-built-this-website">Why I Built This Website</h4> <p>The main reason behind creating this website was to have a professional online presence. Instead of relying solely on LinkedIn or a r√©sum√©, I wanted a space where I could share my projects, write about my interests, and make it easier for professors and researchers to find me.</p> <p>Some of my goals with this site:</p> <ul> <li>Showcase my skills and projects</li> <li>Write about topics I‚Äôm passionate about</li> <li>Connect with researchers and potential collaborators</li> <li>Learn more about web development in the process</li> </ul> <h4 id="the-process">The Process</h4> <p>I started by exploring different options for building the site. At first, I considered website builders like Wix or WordPress, but I wanted something more customizable. After some research, I decided to use <strong>[ Jekyll, Next.js, and plain HTML/CSS]</strong> to build my site from scratch.</p> <p>Some key steps in the process:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Choosing a tech stack</strong> ‚Äì I wanted something lightweight and easy to maintain.</li> <li><strong>Designing the layout</strong> ‚Äì I looked at inspiration from other personal websites.</li> <li><strong>Setting up hosting</strong> ‚Äì I explored options like GitHub Pages, Vercel, and Netlify.</li> <li><strong>Adding content</strong> ‚Äì Writing my bio, listing projects, and setting up a blog.</li> <li><strong>Making it responsive</strong> ‚Äì Ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile.</li> </ol> <h4 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong> ‚Äì A clean and minimalist design works best.</li> <li><strong>Good hosting is key</strong> ‚Äì I found that <strong>[github]</strong> was easy to use and deploy.</li> <li><strong>Content matters</strong> ‚Äì The site isn‚Äôt just about the tech; it‚Äôs about presenting myself well.</li> </ul> <h4 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4> <p>Now that my site is live, I plan to:</p> <ul> <li>Regularly update my blog with my learning journey.</li> <li>Add more projects, especially in computer vision.</li> <li>Improve the design as I learn more about web development.</li> </ul> <p>This process was both fun and challenging, and I‚Äôm excited to see where this site takes me. If you‚Äôre thinking of building your own website, go for it! It‚Äôs a great way to learn and establish an online presence.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúYour personal brand is what people say about you when you‚Äôre not in the room.‚Äù<br/> ‚Äî Jeff Bezos</p> </blockquote> <p>If you‚Äôre interested in computer vision, research, or web development, feel free to connect with me!
