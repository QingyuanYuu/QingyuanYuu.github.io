The ability of machines to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and understand the world around them has always fascinated me. From self-driving cars to medical imaging and even augmented reality, the possibilities seem endless.</p> <p>In this blog post, I want to share why I‚Äôm so passionate about AI and computer vision and how I hope to contribute to this field in the future.</p> <h4 id="the-power-of-ai--computer-vision">The Power of AI &amp; Computer Vision</h4> <p>Computer vision allows machines to analyze and interpret visual data, just like humans do‚Äîbut often faster and with greater precision. Some real-world applications that excite me include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles</strong> ‚Äì Teaching cars to perceive the road and make real-time decisions.</li> <li><strong>Medical Imaging</strong> ‚Äì AI-powered diagnostics that can detect diseases from X-rays and MRIs.</li> <li><strong>Facial Recognition &amp; Biometrics</strong> ‚Äì Enhancing security and authentication systems.</li> <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) &amp; Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> ‚Äì Creating immersive digital experiences.</li> <li><strong>Agriculture &amp; Environmental Monitoring</strong> ‚Äì Using drones to analyze crops and detect environmental changes.</li> </ul> <p>Each of these applications has the potential to transform industries and improve lives, which is what makes this field so exciting to me.</p> <h4 id="how-i-got-interested-in-computer-vision">How I Got Interested in Computer Vision</h4> <p>My interest in computer vision started with <strong>[ece176]</strong>. As I learned more, I realized how powerful AI-driven vision systems could be.</p> <p>Some key moments in my learning journey:</p> <ol> <li><strong>[First exposure to AI/ML]</strong> ‚Äì I took a class or read a paper that introduced me to AI.</li> <li><strong>[First project]</strong> ‚Äì I worked on <strong>[handwritten number detection]</strong>, which deepened my interest.</li> <li><strong>[Recent research/paper that inspired you]</strong> ‚Äì I came across <strong>[mention paper or breakthrough]</strong>, which made me want to explore further.</li> </ol> <h4 id="what-i-want-to-explore-next">What I Want to Explore Next</h4> <p>As I continue my studies at UCSD, I‚Äôm eager to:</p> <ul> <li>Join a research lab focused on AI and computer vision.</li> <li>Work on projects related to <strong>[image segmentation, object detection, generative models, and so on]</strong>.</li> <li>Contribute to open-source projects or competitions like Kaggle.</li> <li>Learn more about deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.</li> </ul> <h4 id="the-future-of-ai--computer-vision">The Future of AI &amp; Computer Vision</h4> <p>Looking ahead, I believe that AI-powered vision systems will become even more advanced, with applications we can‚Äôt even imagine yet. Some areas I‚Äôm excited to follow:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AI-powered creativity</strong> ‚Äì Using computer vision for art, music, and design.</li> <li><strong>Ethics &amp; bias in AI</strong> ‚Äì Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI-driven decisions.</li> <li><strong>Generalized AI models</strong> ‚Äì Creating AI systems that can adapt to multiple tasks like humans.</li> </ul> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúThe real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.‚Äù<br/> ‚Äî Marcel Proust</p> </blockquote> <p>I‚Äôm excited to dive deeper into AI and computer vision and connect with others who share this passion.
