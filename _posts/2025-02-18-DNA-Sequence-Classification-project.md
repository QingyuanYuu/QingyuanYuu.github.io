After days of coding, debugging, and experimenting, I‚Äôve finally completed my **DNA sequence classification project**! This project has been a fascinating dive into **bioinformatics and deep learning**, where I applied **PyTorch** to classify DNA sequences as coding or non-coding. In this post, I‚Äôll walk through what I built, the challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way.  

### Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between **coding** and **non-coding** DNA sequences. I utilized datasets from **Ensembl** and **NCBI**, processed them using **BioPython**, and built a deep learning model using **PyTorch**. The key steps involved:  

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing** ‚Äì Extracting DNA sequences and converting them into numerical representations.  
- **Model Design & Training** ‚Äì Developing a CNN to recognize patterns in the sequences.  
- **Evaluation & Optimization** ‚Äì Fine-tuning hyperparameters and improving model accuracy.  

### Challenges & How I Overcame Them  
This project wasn‚Äôt without its hurdles. Here are a few key challenges I faced and how I tackled them:  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Encoding DNA Sequences**  
DNA sequences consist of **A, T, C, G** bases, so transforming them into a numerical format for deep learning was tricky. I explored one-hot encoding and k-mer frequency representation, ultimately using **one-hot encoding**, as it preserved sequence order better.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Generalization**  
Initially, my model overfitted on the training data. To combat this, I:  
- Used **dropout layers** to prevent over-reliance on specific features.  
- Augmented data by introducing minor mutations in sequences.  
- Applied **batch normalization** to stabilize learning.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Computational Constraints**  
Training deep models on large datasets required significant computational power. I optimized by:  
- **Using batch training** to efficiently handle large datasets.  
- **Leveraging PyTorch‚Äôs GPU acceleration** for faster training.  
- **Tuning hyperparameters** to reduce unnecessary complexity.  

### Key Takeaways & What‚Äôs Next?  
Completing this project reinforced my interest in **bioinformatics and AI**. Some major takeaways include:  

‚úÖ The power of **deep learning** in analyzing biological data.  
‚úÖ The importance of **data preprocessing** in improving model performance.  
‚úÖ The value of **experimentation**‚Äîtweaking model architectures and optimizers made a big difference!  

Moving forward, I want to:  
- **Expand the dataset** to test on more diverse DNA sequences.  
- Explore **transformer-based models** (like DNA-BERT) for sequence classification.  
- **Publish this project on GitHub** to share my work with the community.  
- Look for research opportunities in bioinformatics at UCSD!  

### Final Thoughts  
This project has been an incredible learning experience, combining my skills in **machine learning, bioinformatics, and software development**. It‚Äôs exciting to see how AI can unlock new insights in genomics, and I‚Äôm eager to continue exploring this field.
